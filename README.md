## Le Pendu

French version of the famous Hangman game, originally written in BASIC between 1992 and 1996 by my dad. He used PowerBASIC 2.1 on a modified Amstrad PC 1640.

* PENDU4 is the original program.
* PENDU5 is an attempt to export parts of the program in their own file. It includes a folder called SECOURS which is a earlier backup copy of PENDU5.
